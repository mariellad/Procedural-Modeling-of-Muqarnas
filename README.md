# Procedural-Modeling-of-Muqarnas
Muqarnas is a type of 3D ornamentation used in Islamic Architecture. This form of ornamentation was first developed during the Abbasid Empire. It is a complex stalactite vaulted structure composed of different units arranged one on top of another and spanning several tiers. The primary purpose of Muqarnas was to create a transition between a circular dome and the square structure beneath it.

This project uses procedural modeling to recreate several types of 3D Muqarnas models based on fixed sets of rules, using Rhino and Grasshopper.
